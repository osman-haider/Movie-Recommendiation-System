# Movie-Recommendiation-System

The Movie Recommendation System is a web-based application developed in Python that aims to provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their current watchlist. Leveraging the vast movie database of The Movie Database (TMDB), this system employs advanced algorithms to identify and suggest similar movies to those that users are currently watching.

### How it Works

The recommendation process begins with users inputting their currently watched movies or creating a watchlist on the platform. The system then utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to analyze user preferences and movie characteristics. Collaborative filtering analyzes user behavior and interactions to find like-minded users and recommend movies that others with similar tastes enjoyed. Content-based filtering, on the other hand, identifies key attributes of the movies users are currently watching and recommends movies with similar attributes, such as genre, actors, directors, and more.
